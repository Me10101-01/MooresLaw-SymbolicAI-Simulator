# MooresLaw-SymbolicAI-Simulator
Visualizes Mooreâ€™s Law exponential growth using symbolic computation. Toggle 2014 transistor baselines (e.g., 2.6B vs 5.56B) to see how different interpretations of the same chart affect 2040 predictions. Built with Python, SymPy, and interactive graphs. Based on our class discussion on chart discrepancies.
