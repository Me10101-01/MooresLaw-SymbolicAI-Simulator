# 🧠 Moore’s Law Symbolic AI Visualizer

**QuantumSymbolicAI-Emulator** is a symbolic AI simulator that models exponential growth under Moore’s Law using interactive computation and graphing.

It allows users to **toggle different 2014 transistor baselines** (e.g., 2.6B, 5.56B, 8B) and see how predictions scale to 2040 through 13 doublings. Designed to resolve discrepancies in charts like the famous **Wikipedia transistor count plot**.

## 📊 Example Output

| 2014 Baseline | Chip Type                        | 2040 Estimate         |
|---------------|----------------------------------|------------------------|
| 2.6B          | Intel Core i7-5960X (Consumer)   | 21.3 Trillion          |
| 5.56B         | Intel Xeon E7 v3 (Server)        | 45.55 Trillion         |
| 8B            | Hypothetical High-End            | 65.53 Trillion         |
