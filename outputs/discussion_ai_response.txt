**Student:** Domenic Garza
**Year Start:** 2014
**Target Year:** 2040
**Doubling Period:** 2 years
**Initial Transistors:** 5,560,000,000.0

Using Moore’s Law:  
N(t) = N₀ × 2^(t / 2)  
N(2040) = 5,560,000,000.0 × 2^(26)/2)  
→ ≈ 45,547,520,000,000 transistors

**Conclusion:** Based on Moore’s Law, the estimated number of transistors per IC in 2040 is approximately 45.55 trillion.
